What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  When you initialise a repository a hidden folder .git is added to the
  folder making it a git repository.
  The .git folder will now contain all the metadata regarding the files that are
  being tracked for changes.The metadata pertains to the various changes that
  have been made to the files and saved as checkpoints/commits to the git
  repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
  A working directory contains all the files which are related to each other
  in some logical sense.
  A staging area is an intermediate area where the relevant files can be
  gathered as one logical unit which can be committed using a single commit.
  It is not necessary that all the files in the working directory are staged
  all at once for a single commit.
  A repository contains meta data for tracking changes to all the files added
  to the repository, which again might not be all the files in the working
  directory.
   Say you're working on two features - one is finished, and one still needs
   some work done. You'd like to make a commit and go home (5 o'clock, finally!)
   but wouldn't like to commit the parts of the second feature, which is not
   done yet. You stage the parts you know belong to the first feature, and
   commit. Now your commit is your project with the first feature done,
   while the second is still in work-in-progress in your working directory.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

organized? How would branches help?

the diagram the way we do?
