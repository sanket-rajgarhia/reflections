Q.1 When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

    The reason for using a remote repository rather than keeping all your
    work local are as follows:
    1. Serves as a backup of your local repository.
    2. Allows you to collaborate and share your projects with other people
       on the web.
    3. Your projects are easily accessible from anywhere.

Q2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    The reasons why you would want to pull changes manually from a remote
    repository rather than git automatically syncing is to avoid a certain
    situation where in you are working on a branch and are in the middle of an
    implementation.In such a case you would like to complete your implementation
    and commit your work to your local repository before you sync the local
    repository with any additional new changes (commits) made to the remote
    repository.

Q3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?

    Fork - Is a concept limited to Github. Fork is to make a copy of someone
    else's repository under your own account in the Github server. You can
    now have an identical repository under your account as the one you forked.
    You can not clone this repository under your account to your local machine
    and make changes and commit them locally, after which you can push these
    changes back to the repository under your account.
    You could also add collaborators who could make changes to this repository
    under your account.
    This repository links back to the original repository you used to fork in
    the first place and it makes it easier to suggest changes to the original,
    since you may not have the permission to make changes to the original
    repository.
    Forking someone else's repository also keeps track of the number of people
    who have forked this repository.

    Clone - Is to make a copy of a repository from a url to your local machine.
    You could also use a local repository and clone it to a different location
    on your local system.
    Cloning is typically used to make a local copy of your Github repository on
    the local system so that changes can be easily made and pushed back to the
    Github repository when complete and committed.

    Branches - A branch is a series of commits that originates at a commit on
    some other branch (typically a master branch). A branch represents a
    version of your files and folders in the repository.
    When you want to create a new feature or try an experiment you could make a
    new branch in git and `checkout` the new branch to continue working.
    This does not disturb the original version of your project (the master
    branch) and you could switch versions simply by switching branches.
    When you switch branches the files and folders in the repository are
    automatically updated to correspond to their last commit state.
    Once you have completed adding the new feature or experiment - you can
    merge the branch into your master branch (post resolution of conflicts if
    any) and delete the experimental/new-feature branch.
    If the branch is not merged with the master and you attempt to delete it,
    you will loose all your commits in the experimental branch. However, if
    you remember their commit ID you can still access them unless the git
    garbage collector runs automatically.
