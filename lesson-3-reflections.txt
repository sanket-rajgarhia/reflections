Q.1 When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

    The reason for using a remote repository rather than keeping all your
    work local are as follows:
    1. Serves as a backup of your local repository.
    2. Allows you to collaborate and share your projects with other people
       on the web.
    3. Your projects are easily accessible from anywhere.

Q2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    The reasons why you would want to pull changes manually from a remote
    repository rather than git automatically syncing is to avoid a certain
    situation where in you are working on a branch and are in the middle of an
    implementation.In such a case you would like to complete your implementation
    and commit your work to your local repository before you sync the local
    repository with any additional new changes (commits) made to the remote
    repository.
